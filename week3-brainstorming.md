## Initial Discussion

 * Do you have any technical background?
   * No
 * Who is it for? Students, teachers?
   * Not sure, for now, let's say both.
 * What is bad with the current system?
   * Everything
   * User exeprience is not great. (too many clicks to get where you're going)
   * No mobile website (but there is an app)
   * Hard to find what you're looking for.
   * On-line assignment submission is buggy.
   * No integration with external resources (e.g. websites not on the current system)
   * Features that nobody uses (e.g. group voting)
   * Slow loading
   * Bad notification centre.

## Desinging our MVP

We will focus on *Dan the commuter*.

User stories:
 * As Dan, I want to access all of the course info for courses I am registered in, so that I don't have to go to different websites.
 * As Dan, I want a calendar on the homepage, so I can view all of my deadlines, and manage my TODO items in one central place. 
 * As Dan, I want to access the website from my computer, phone and tablet, because I use all of these devices throughout the day.
 * As Dan, I would like some sort of a student-only social layer in the portal, so that I can contact students (without thinking about what the profs miht say/do).
 * A discussion board.


## MVP

An online portal for University students, with convenient schedule and time management features.
Think of Blackboard, where a calendar and a TODO list are the centre of attention.
