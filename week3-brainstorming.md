## Initial Discussion

 * Do you have any technical background?
   * No
 * Who is it for? Students, teachers?
   * Not sure, for now, let's say both.
 * What is bad with the current system?
   * Everything
   * User exeprience is not great. (too many clicks to get where you're going)
   * No mobile website (but there is an app)
   * Hard to find what you're looking for.
   * On-line assignment submission is buggy.
   * No integration with external resources (e.g. websites not on the current system)
   * Features that nobody uses (e.g. group voting)
   * Slow loading
   * Bad notification centre.
