 * Up to 6 people per team.
 * Small teams (i.e. less than 4) might get merged with other teams.
 * The teams for this exercise, and the teams for the project are different (think of this exercise as a "test run").


That's it for now, on Wednesday evening we will create your team repositories that you will use for this exercise.
