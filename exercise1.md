# Exercise 1

We have released Exercise1.    

Go to [our course organization page](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014), and you should see your team's repository (its name starts with _Ex1_) in the list.

The handout and starter code are in the team's repository.


**Note:** If you did not register for a team, you will need to contact your Instructor/TA and get set up manually.
Unfortunately, by not registering for a team on time, you lost 25% of the mark for this exercise.
